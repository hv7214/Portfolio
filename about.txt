<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I am Harshit Verma, first of all thanks to giving a look here. I am a  UG student in IIT Roorkee, pursuing Computer
  Science Engineering.<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
  I love exploring stuffs that are more abstracted, because they generate a wave of curoisity in me. This habit lead me to explore Network Security.
  I always used to think how codes written in High Level Language would communicate to hardware, how just it instruct latter to do perform some task.This got me into NETSEC.
  <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
  I also develop web apps on Node.js and CLI tools too on Node.js. I have also been into game dev, I made one-to-one 2.5D fighting game
  Marvel vs DC in my 1st semester during WOC.<br><br>
  I am also contributing in some open source projects, just to get a good feel of doing something free of cost(lol!).
  I am still expanding my domain in field on Computer Science.<br><br><br>
